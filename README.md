# Starter template for Ionic with React and Vite
This is a minimal starter template for Ionic with React and Vite.

## Installation
Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app
Run the following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build the app
Run the following command to build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Capacitor
Because of Vite you will need to use Capacitor CLI.

```bash
# Do use Capacitor CLI
npx capacitor ...

# Don't use Ionic CLI
ionic capacitor ...
```

Ionic CLI will use react-scripts to build the app.
